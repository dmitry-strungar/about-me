# Dmitry Strungar — BI Analyst (Junior)

## About Me

I am a Junior BI Analyst with practical experience in data analysis, SQL, Python, and BI tools. I focus on transforming raw data into clear insights and interactive dashboards to support business decision-making.

I completed a professional retraining program in BI Analytics, where I developed analytical solutions including product analytics, customer segmentation, SQL-based analysis, and management dashboards.

My portfolio demonstrates the full analytics workflow: data preparation, metric calculation, analysis, and visualization.

I am currently seeking a Junior BI Analyst position where I can contribute to business analytics and continue developing my skills in a commercial environment.
